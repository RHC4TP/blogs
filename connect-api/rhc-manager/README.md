Red Hat Container Manager
=========================

This program allows you to retrieve information about the container project from Red Hat Connect and trigger manual builds without needing to log into the website. At the time of writing, this is using [V2](https://connect.redhat.com/zones/containers/v2-api-docs-container-certification) of the API.

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Build service **must** be enabled for your project prior to running these commands for this to work.

## Usage

Just pull the container and run the commands from within the container session.

#### Steps

1. `docker pull quay.io/gfranchini/rhc-manager`
2. `docker run -it --rm quay.io/gfranchini/rhc-manager`
3. Run commands to get either project info or build a new project.

**Get Project Info:**

```sh
./rhc_cli.rb -i <project_id>
```

```

#### How To Find Your Project ID
Your project ID can be found in the "Upload Your Image" tab on the main page of your project. Scroll to the bottom where it says "Push Your Container" and you will find a `docker push` command similar to this: `docker push scan.connect.redhat.com/ospid-3aeb2x96-8c59-4ea7-3dc8-c50481fb49c9/[image-name]:[tag]`. The long string starting with ospid or sometimes pid is your project ID.

### To Do

* Add an error when the response times out.
* Check if API is down.
* Add tests and validations.
