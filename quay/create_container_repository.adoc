This guide serves as a demonstration for creating a new container repository in https://quay.io[Quay]. Here we'll walkthrough creating a repository for container images, building and tagging your container locally, pushing the image to Quay, and pulling images. 

== Prerequisites: 
*Quay.io account* - you can register for a Quay account https://quay.io/signin/[here]

*Docker installed* - follow Docker's https://docs.docker.com/install/[documentation] to find the correct installation for your system

== Step One: Create Repository
*_Click on "Create New Repository"_*

*_Set type to "Container Image Repository" and input a repository name. Optionally, add a description._*

image::container-image.png[]
---

*_Set the repository to public_*

image::public-repo.png[]
---
*_Initialize as empty. Then click "Create Public Repository"_*

== Step Two: Build Container
Now that your container repository is setup, build your container. I'll be building a simple Apache web server, using a RHEL base image. You can find the Dockerfile https://github.com/RHC4TP/starter/blob/master/Container%20Zone/Examples/WebServer_Dockerfile_RHEL[here]. +

*_Build the container_*
----
docker build . 
----
*_Run the container_*
----
docker run -d -p 8080:80 <IMAGE ID>
----
*_Tag the active container to an image name_*
----
docker commit <CONTAINER ID> quay.io/username/repo
----

The method above describes creating an image based off an active container. If you'd like to build an image from the Dockerfile and tag it right away, try this: 
----
docker build -t quay.io/username/repo . 
----

== Step Three: Push Image

Now we can push our container image to our repository we created

*_Login to Quay using Docker_*
----
docker login quay.io
----

*_Push the image_*
----
docker push quay.io/username/repo
----
== Step Four: Pull Image
With our image pushed to our repository, you can now pull the image and make changes locally
----
docker pull quay.io/username/repo
----
