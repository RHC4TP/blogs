== Testing out the OpenShift 4.0 Developer Preview in AWS
The OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 4.0 developer preview is available, which showcases the following new technologies in conjunction with OpenShift:
* Red Hat CoreOS - A new immutable, container based OS merging key features from Container Linux and RHEL Atomic
* An all new automated installater that supports AWS (using Terraform), OpenStack, and libvirt (development only)
* Operator Hub - A new marketplace interface for Operators that integrates with the Operator Lifecycle Manager

The install process begins by visiting https://try.openshift.com, clicking the Get Started link and logging in with your RHN ID.
The entire deployment is a relatively simply 5-step process:
. Register a domain
. Setup your AWS credentials
. Download the installer
. Create a cluster
. Access the new cluster

In this post, we'll go over each of these steps and give some oversight into how the installer works, which should https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/master/docs/user/troubleshooting.md[aid in troubleshooting].

=== Register your AWS Route53 Domain
Assuming that you already have an account setup in AWS (and no domain created yet), sign into the AWS Console and select Route53 from the Services menu.
Click "Registered Domains" in the side bar and then Register Domain (in blue) near the top of the page.

Once you've completed the registration process, it can take up to 3 days for the registration to finalize (although typically within an hour).

=== Setup your AWS API Credentials
You won't need the AWS CLI or SDK installed, however you will need to https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key/[create an Access Key] for your IAM account.
The key ID and secret key will need to be added to `~/.aws/credentials` in the following format:

 [default]
 aws_access_key_id = <access_key_id>
 aws_secret_access_key = <secret_access_key>

While you're at it, go ahead and set a default region to create your cluster in.
Add the AWS region of your choice (eg: us-east-2) to `~/.aws/config`:

 [default]
 region=<region>

=== Download the OpenShift Installer 
The OpenShift 4.0 Dev Preview installer for your platform (assumed to be Fedora/RHEL/CentOS) can be downloaded from GitHub:

https://github.com/openshift/installer/releases

Once you've finished downloading the installer, rename it and make it executable by copying it to $HOME/bin:

 mkdir $HOME/bin
 mv openshift-install-linux-amd64 $HOME/bin/openshift-install
 chmod +x $HOME/bin/openshift-install

=== Create the Cluster
In my experience, it helps to create a subdirectory to house the installer's artifacts:

 mkdir ~/ocp40test
 cd ~/ocp40test

Now run the installer from the newly created directory:

 openshift-install create cluster

You'll then be prompted to select or provide following info:
* SSH Public key (if you select None, then you won't be able to connect to your instances over SSH)
* Platform (aws)
* Region (detected from `~/.aws/config` if set)
* Base Domain (detected from Route53)
* Cluster Name (the name you want your AWS resources to be tagged with)
* Pull Secret (answer `?` here and follow the link to obtain the user-specific json string)

Once you've gone through all of the required prompts, you should see the install progress:

 INFO Creating cluster...                          
 INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the Kubernetes API... 
 INFO API v1.12.4+f39ab668d3 up                    
 INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the bootstrap-complete event... 
 WARNING RetryWatcher - getting event failed! Re-creating the watcher. Last RV: 3179 
 INFO Destroying the bootstrap resources...        
 INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the cluster to initialize... 
 INFO Waiting up to 10m0s for the openshift-console route to be created... 
 INFO Install complete!                            

Note that there is quite a time lapse between each output line shown above.
To see what is going on behind the scenes, you can tail the installation log in another terminal window:

 cd ~/ocp40test 
 tail -f .openshift_install.log

Once the installation completes, you'll be provided (in the installer's console output) the URL for logging in via the web console.
You'll also be provided the password for the `kubeadmin` account.
What's notably missing, however is the URL for access via the `oc` or `kubectl` commands.
This URL can be obtained from the install log, or by substituting for your `<clustername>` and `<basedomain>` in the following command:

 oc login -u kubeadmin https://<clustername>-api.<basedomain>:6443

The 4.0 build of the `oc` binary can be accessed by visiting https://cloud.openshift.com/clusters/install and clicking the link at the bottom of the page.

=== Troubleshooting
If something goes wrong, there is currently no way to roll back an installation (eg: remove resources created in AWS up to the point of failure).
All resources get created in a new VPC, so it's fairly easy to manually clean up after.
Just shut down the instances and delete the VPC, and the AWS console will list any resources that are blocking the removal.
In the case of failure, check the https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/master/docs/user/troubleshooting.md[troubleshooting] page on GitHub.
You can also check the GitHub https://github.com/openshift/installer/issues[issues] section for any known bugs in the installer.
