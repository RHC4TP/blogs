== Adding the Operator Lifecycle Manager to OpenShift 3.11
OpenShift Container Platform v3.11 was released in recent weeks, and with it the Operator Lifecycle Manager (part of the https://github.com/operator-framework[Operator Framework]) was released with OpenShift as a Technology Preview. In this post, we'll focus on using Ansible to install OLM using the provided playbook. To continue, you'll need an existing OpenShift Container Platform cluster, as well as root-level access to the hosts within the cluster. You will need the original Ansible inventory (aka hosts) file that was used to deploy your cluster, as well as cluster-admin permissions within OpenShift. These permissions are satisfied by the `system:admin` account provided to root on the master hosts.

You'll need to setup authentication to the Red Hat Container Catalog for your OpenShift cluster. We've covered this in another blog post, but the synopsis involves adding the following variable to your Ansible hosts file under the `[OSEv3:vars]` section, replacing `<your_user_name>` and `<your_password>` with your Red Hat account credentials:

----
...
`[OSEv3:vars]`
...
openshift_additional_registry_credentials=[{'host':'registry.connect.redhat.com','user':'<your_user_name>','password':'<your_password>','test_image':'mongodb/enterprise-operator:0.3.2'}]
----

Once you've made the necessary edit to your Ansible hosts file, run the following playbook, which will configure the authentication to the RHCC registry for your cluster:

----
# ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/updates/registry_auth.yml
----

Once the above playbook successfully completes, you can install the OLM feature using the following Ansible playbook:

----
# ansible-playbook -i <inventory_file> /usr/share/ansible/openshift-ansible/playbooks/olm/config.yml
----

When the playbook completes, there will be a new *Operators* menu item in the OpenShift cluster console:

You're now ready to begin testing operators using the new Operator Lifecycle Manager. We'll follow up with another blog covering this topic soon, but in the meantime you can follow the official https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/installing-operator-framework.html#launching-your-first-operator_installing-operator-framework[OpenShift 3.11 documentation] to launch your first operator.
